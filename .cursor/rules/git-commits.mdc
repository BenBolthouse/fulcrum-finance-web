### Commits and Pushes
- **DO NOT commit or push code unless explicitly told to do so**
- All git commits and pushes require explicit user approval

### Message Format
```
(#[issue number]) [description]

```

### Message Components
- **Description**-Should be less than or equal to 36 characters in length. Should briefly describe the changes in the commit.
- **Issue number**-Should be the issue number corresponding to the issue tracker identifier. This can be found on the present Git branch following the format `[type]/[issue number]/[optional description]`, e.g.: `feature/199/add-express-api`, or simply `feature/199`.
- **Email**-Should be the email address of the code committer.
- **Bulleted list**-Should contain a list of changes included in the commit. If the commit is short and the description provides enough pertinent detail about the changes, then omit the bulleted list.

### Message Validation
- **Imperative tone**-Description and bulleted list items should be in the imperative voice.
- **No periods**-Description and bulleted list should not contain periods. Other puncuation is acceptable.
- **Committer email**-Email should be the email of the committer. If necessary, use the Git command line tools to find the email address of the committer.
